# Java Interview Excercises
## Various Java excercises to deepen your knowledge of Java and to prepare for your first Java job interview.

1. Package: **amstrongnumber**

An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.

2.	Package: **binarynumberornot**

In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one).

3.	Package: **binarysearchinarray**

Program searches for the number you entered in your int array.

4.	Package: **deadlock**

This example shows one of the threading problems – deadlock. Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on the other.

5.	Package: **greatestcommondivisor**

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.

6.	Package: **duplicatecharacters**

Program calculates duplicate characters in a given String.

7.	Package: **equalityoftwoarrays**

Program shows if two given int arrays are equal or not.

8.	Package: **factorial**

The factorial of n is denoted by n! and calculated by the product of integer numbers from 1 to n, for example: 5! = 1×2×3×4×5 = 120.

9.	Package: **fibonacci**

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…

10.	Package: **largestnumberwithoutgivennumber**

Program excludes number from your given number, for example number 586, exclude 8 will be 579 (there is no 8 in the number).

11.	Package: **leapyear**

Enter year and the program shows if it is leap year or not.

12.	Package: **nonRepeadedCharacterInAString**

Program finds firs non repeatd character in a given String, foe example: aaaaaggggguuudt, first non repeated character is d.

13.	Package: **numberpalindrome**

Palindrome number is a number which is equal to reverse of itself. For example 121 is a palindrome because reverse of 121 is 121.

14.	Package: **ocurenciesinastringcount**

Program counts all ocurencies of a given String, for example: the given word “hello” Occurencies are: {e=1, h=1, l=2, o=1}.

15.	Package: **palindrome**

Program checks if a given String is a palindrome or not. Palindrome String is a String which is equal to reverse of itself, for example “level” is palindrome, because reverse “level” and you get “level”.

16.	Package: **piramidofnumbers**

Enter number and program draws a pyramid of them.

17.	Package: **primenumber**

Enter number and program shows if it is prime number or not.

18.	Package: **removewhitespacefromastring**

Program removes all white spaces in a given String.

19.	Package: **reversearray**

Program reverses given array.

20.	Package: **reversenumber**

Enter number and program will reverse your number.

21.	Package: **reversestring**

Enter String and program will reverse your String.

22.	 Package: **reversewordinasentence**

Program will reverse all words in a sentence.

23.	Package: **secondlargestnumberinanarray**

Program will find second largest number in an array.

24.	Package: **squareroot**

Program calculates square root of a given number.

25.	Package: **stringanagram**

Program shows anagram of a given String.

26.	Package: **sumofalldigitsinanumber**

Program calculates sum of all digits of a given number, for example: 563, will be 5+6+3=14.
